#
# The npm and PyPI packagers take binaries from `dist/`. When they run at
# release time that directory is right there from the build. When they run
# *later* — after a human has published the draft, which is when publishing to
# an irreversible registry should happen — it is not, and rebuilding would give
# npm and PyPI a binary that is merely *equivalent* to the released one rather
# than identical to it.
#
# So this fetches the published archives and verifies them against the release's
# own checksums.txt before unpacking. Same reasoning as install.sh: this project
# argues that you check artifacts instead of trusting where they came from, and
# our own pipeline is the last place that should take an unverified byte.

// of those sets `os`/`cpu`, so npm installs exactly the one that matches and
// skips the rest — the user downloads one binary, not four.

// Why a JS shim rather than letting the platform package declare `bin`:
// npm's linking of binaries from *optional* dependencies is not dependable
// across npm/pnpm/yarn versions, and the failure mode is a missing command with
// no explanation. Resolving here means a missing platform package produces a

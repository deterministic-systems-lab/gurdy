// TestDecisionServiceTimeDistribution reports the *distribution* of the proxy's
// own decision work, not its mean.
//
// This exists because the end-to-end harness cannot resolve a 5ms p99 on a
// shared machine: the loopback stack and the OS scheduler contribute a tail an
// order of magnitude larger than the budget, so `p99(proxied) − p99(direct)`
// measures the host, not the proxy. But that noise is all in the *hop*. The
// work the proxy actually performs — derive + extract + eval + enqueue — is
// in-process, on a monotonic clock, with no syscall in the measured region, and
// its tail is therefore attributable and resolvable right here.
//
// So NFR-1's budget splits cleanly into a part we can certify anywhere and a
// part that needs a deployment:
//
//	hop + derive + extract + eval  ≤ 5ms p99
//	└─ needs a real     ┘ └─ this test ─────┘
//	   network to measure
//
// A `go test -bench` cannot do this: it reports ns/op averaged over the run, and
// an average is exactly what hides a tail. Reported rather than asserted,
// because a threshold here would be a threshold on whatever machine CI happens
// to schedule — the numbers go in the roadmap and a regression shows up as a
// change in them.

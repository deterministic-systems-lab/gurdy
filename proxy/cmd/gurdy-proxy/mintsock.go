// The sideband TIS API (D1, §5.9): root mint and child derive, and nothing
// else. Three deliberate boundaries, each of which was the wrong answer at
// some point in the design:
//
//   - Not the admin API. §7's disarm row — a prompt-injected agent on the box
//     calling /policy/rollback — is already unmitigated; adding credential
//     issuance to that surface widens a hole instead of opening a separate,
//     narrow one.
//   - Not a reverse-proxy path carve-out. A governed agent reaches the proxy's
//     tool endpoint by definition, so any mint path mounted there is reachable
//     by exactly the party that must not be able to quietly re-identify itself.
//   - No /derive-call. Per-call assertions are derived by the proxy from the
//     txn token it is already handed; exposing that would let an agent choose
//     the `tool` its own assertion names.
//
// A Unix socket, not a port: the SDK runs beside the proxy in every topology
// that has one (dev mode's embedded core, the sidecar's shared volume), and a
// socket cannot be reached from another host by accident or by scan.
//
// **Mint is unauthenticated in v1, deliberately.** What it issues is *asserted*
// identity (§5.2) — a claim the ledger records as a claim and policy sees only
// as reserved context. Gating it would distribute a secret to every agent
// without changing what a record means. The file mode is the access control:
// owner-only, so "who may mint" is "who may act as this user", which is
// already true of anything running here. `cnf` proof-of-possession lands with
// the SDK. **This stops being adequate the moment enforcement or a
// scope-reading policy exists** — MintTxn accepts any root scope, so an
// injected agent can mint `scope=*` (roadmap §3.B, Phase 2 gate).

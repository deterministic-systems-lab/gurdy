// The per-call hot path, benchmarked as the proxy actually runs it.
//
// §3.2 NFR-1 defines that path as "hop + derive + extract + eval", with mint
// explicitly per-task and amortized. These measure everything except the hop —
// the hop needs a real listener and real concurrency, which is gurdy-bench's
// job, because §8.2 forbids certifying NFR-1 by summing standalone numbers.
//
// What these are for is the opposite of certification: finding which component
// dominates, and catching a change that makes one of them an order of magnitude
// worse. A composed measurement tells you whether you passed; only these tell
// you why.

// BenchmarkDecideCall is the whole in-process decision: identify (verify the
// txn, derive a call assertion, verify it), classify, evaluate, and enqueue the
// record. Everything the proxy does between reading the body and forwarding it.

// take a process-wide exclusive lock and perform an ES256 *verify* of the
// cached token while holding it, serialising every concurrent request behind
// one signature check, at 65,018 ns/op against 23,973 for the SDK path.
//
// It now caches the expiry and checks a clock under a read lock: 18,345 ns/op,
// 3.55x faster, 75 fewer allocations. Keep this paired with the serial
// benchmark above — a future change that reintroduces per-call work under the

// BenchmarkDecideCallParallelWithTxn is the same parallel load, but with a

//
// It was the fast one before D12 and is now the slow one (23,973 ns/op against
// 18,345), because it still performs a full ES256 VerifyTxn on every call while
// the no-SDK path performs none.
//
// **That asymmetry is correct and must stay.** A supplied token is the agent's
// claim, arriving on every request and controlled by the party being governed;
// it has to be verified each time it is presented. The auto-minted token is one
// we minted ourselves and never let out of memory, so the only thing that could
// change about it is the clock. Caching a verification result for the supplied
// token would turn one valid presentation into a standing pass, which is the
// forged-credential case in `conformance/cases/05` — the speedup here is not a
// pattern to copy across.
//
// It also doubles as the control for D12: this path was untouched by that
// change and its number did not move, which is what makes the other benchmark's
// 3.55x attributable to the change rather than to the machine.

// roughly 0.45µs per KiB: nothing for a typical MCP reply of a few KB, ~3ms for
// an 8 MB one, which is most of the NFR-1 p99 budget on its own.

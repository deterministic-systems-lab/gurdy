# Every commit in a pull request must carry a Signed-off-by matching its author
# (DCO, see ../DCO and CONTRIBUTING.md).
#
# Usage: check-dco.sh <base-ref> <head-ref>
#
# We chose a DCO over a CLA because contributed code stays in the open half and
# is never moved into the paid product. That promise runs in both directions:
# the contributor's sign-off is the only record that they had the right to
# submit the patch, so a sign-off nobody verifies is the whole agreement
# decaying into an honour system. The codebase already says a rule enforced by
# discipline decays; this is that rule applied to itself.
#
# ponytail: matches the sign-off email against the commit author's, which is the
# claim that actually matters — someone else's name on the line is not the
# author certifying. Not checked: that the email is real, or that a
# `Signed-off-by` from a third party carries a genuine DCO (c) chain of custody.
# Both need a human, and both are why maintainers read patches.

Fix with:
  git rebase --signoff <base-branch>     # sign off everything on this branch
  git commit --amend -s                  # just the tip; delete any Co-authored-by: Cursor line

Then force-push. See CONTRIBUTING.md — it is a one-line certification, not a CLA.

# Fail if anything linked into the binaries carries a licence we cannot
# redistribute under Apache-2.0 (ADR-13).
#
# This is the guard, not the headers. ADR-13 draws the grant boundary at the
# repository "rather than argued file-by-file", so per-file SPDX headers would
# be churn against the decision's own rationale — they also guard nothing. What
# can actually break the outbound grant is an *inbound* dependency: one GPL or
# SSPL module linked into gurdy-proxy and the Apache-2.0 we publish is no longer
# a licence we are in a position to offer. That regression is silent, arrives in
# a routine `go get`, and is discovered by someone else's legal review.
#
# Deliberately not `go-licenses`: it needs a Go install of a Google tool in CI
# to do what 40 lines of shell does against the module cache we already have.
#
# ponytail: matches licence *text*, not SPDX metadata. A module whose LICENSE is
# a bare URL or an unusual dual-licence header lands in UNRECOGNISED and needs a
# human — which is the correct failure direction. Switch to go-licenses or
# scancode if that list ever gets long enough to be annoying.

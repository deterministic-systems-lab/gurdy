"""Rendering: Markdown for a person, JSON for a tool. Templates, never an LLM.

§5.6 is explicit that narratives are generated from decision data via templates —
"an LLM-written audit artifact undermines the entire independence pitch." So this
module is string formatting and nothing else. Two identical exports produce two
byte-identical reports, which is what lets a reviewer diff last month's against
this month's and lets anyone reproduce the artifact from the ledger they were
handed.

Markdown rather than HTML or PDF for the free tier: diffable, greppable, readable
with no browser, and it renders wherever the reader already is. The paid tier's
job is the framework-mapped HTML/PDF (§5.6); making the free one pretty first
would be optimising the wrong artifact.

The renderer walks claims and cannot do otherwise — it has no access to the
underlying records — so a number cannot reach the page without the citation that
`claims.Claim` forced it to carry.

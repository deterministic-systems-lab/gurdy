"""Building the report model: the honesty rules live here, not in the template.

The template renders claims. Which claims exist, and whether the document may be
rendered as an ordinary report at all, is decided here — so a presentation change
cannot quietly relax an evidentiary rule.

The list this is designed against, which is the list of ways a report built from
real data still misleads its reader:

1. **Denominator.** Percentages are over *records written*, never over "traffic".
   The proxy can only count what it saw and what it managed to record; traffic
   that never reached it is outside every number by construction, and that
   sentence appears in the report rather than in this docstring.
2. **Survivorship.** The append queue drops on overflow. A run with drops has an
   unknown population, so its counts are floors and are labelled as such.
3. **Absence is not zero.** "No policy flagged anything" is supportable from an
   export; "nothing happened" is not. Absence claims must say what is absent.
4. **Monitor mode.** `decision=block` means *would have* blocked. A count of
   flagged calls with no statement that none were stopped is not an enforcement
   claim (§5.6).
5. **Unanswered calls.** A decision with no response record may have succeeded,
   failed, or still be in flight. It is never counted as a success.
6. **Unsigned tails.** Records past the last batch signature are chain-linked but
   unsigned, and a chain link is recomputable by anyone with file access.
   Reporting over them without saying so is reporting over forgeable data.
7. **Unrecorded time.** Liveness gaps and a missing shutdown record mean the
   period contains time in which nothing was written. The period is then not the
   period the reader thinks it is.

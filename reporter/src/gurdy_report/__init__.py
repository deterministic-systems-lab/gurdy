"""gurdy-report — the free-tier local governance report (BR-11, §5.6).

Compiles a hash-chained decision ledger into an artifact a security owner can
hand to a reviewer. Deterministic and template-driven: no model anywhere in the
path, because an LLM-written audit artifact would undermine the independence
claim the product rests on (§5.6).

Three properties are load-bearing, each because of a specific way a report built
from real data still misleads its reader:

- **It does not verify the chain itself.** §3.3 keeps one implementation of that
  in the Go core; this invokes ``gurdy-verify -json`` and consumes the verdict.
  Two implementations of a signature check drift, and the permissive one is the
  one that ships a green report over a forged export.
- **It refuses rather than caveats when the evidence is not evidence.** An export
  that fails verification produces a NOT REPORTABLE document and a nonzero exit,
  because a report over unverified records looks exactly like a report over sound
  ones.
- **Every claim carries its citation as a matter of type, not discipline.** A
  :class:`~gurdy_report.claims.Claim` cannot be built without the seqs it rests
  on, and the renderer can see nothing else.
